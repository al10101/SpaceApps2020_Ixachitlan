The rn.py code predicts the animal distribution given a collection of map layers obtained form NASA satellites.


This repository contains 7 PNG files, 200x200 pixels each:
1. Chlorophyll_RESIZE.png
2. Temperature_RESIZE.png
3. currents_RESIZE.png
4. energy_flux_RESIZE.png
5. height_anomalies_RESIZE.png
6. photoAv_RESIZE.png
7. dist5_RESIZE.png

All images from 1st to 6th were obtained from the NASA satelites (SW: 34, -125 & NE: 37, -121) and will be the input data. All images were obtained from 2016 data.
The 7th image was constructed manually with information reported by DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-50961-z, with white spots corresponding to pelagic ecosystems, and will be the output data.
First, by running process_data.py the X (input) and y (output) data will be created. X will be a 18x40000 matrix, with each column corresponding to a different pixel from the input data; y will be a 1x40000 matrix, indicating wether that pixel has pelagic ecosystem or not.
Those matrices will be saved in X.csv and y.csv files respectively.
The rn.py code reads both files and trains a classification neural network. The later consists has 500x500x100x1 neurons, distributed in 4 layers. 
The final output will give a 1x40000 matrix with the corresponding predictions.

NOTES:
- For a given prediction, the same kind of data must be given (chlorophyll, temperature, ocean currents, energy flux, height animalies and photosynthetically available radiation.
- All images must be 200x200 pixels.
